# MidiMapper (In Development)

## Overview
MidiMapper is a Windows Form Application that maps MIDI signals into customizable keyboard/mouse input. The keyboard/mouse input is done through the ... library in order to support  DirectX and therefore allowing in-game inputs.

The application allows for profiles to be created and loaded. This way it is possible to easily switch between user-made profiles. These profiles can be described through `.txt` files as explained [here](user-profiles) or can be managed with the application's interface.

The following diagram displays the architecture of the system:
